===========
# 1. What is arduino_light_switch?
This repository is created to proceed my project for arduino light switch. For few years, turning on&off the light keeps bothering me since there is no switch near my bed, so that I have to walk.
# 2. How to do
## 2.1. How to control light switch
### 2.1.1. Motor
To use motor is the easiest and cheapest way to control light switch. It might be little messy and inaccurate.
### 2.1.2. Relay
To use relay is also cheap and easy way, but it has a risk of electric shock, and also I have to get rid of it when my contract with landlord is expired.
### 2.1.3. So?
I`ll use motor to control light switch.
